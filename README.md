Alzheimer's is a progressive brain disorder which is an untreatable, and inoperable and mostly affect the elderly people. There is a new case of Alzheimer's disease being discovered globally in every four seconds. The outcome is fatal, as it results in death. Timely identification of Alzheimer's disease can be beneficial for us to get necessary care and possibly even avert brain tissue damage by the time. Effective automated techniques are required for detecting Alzheimer's disease at very early stage. Researchers use a variety of novel approaches to classify Alzheimer's disease. machine learning, an AI branch use probabilistic technique that allow system to acquire knowledge from huge amount of data. In this paper we represent a analysis report of the work which is done by researcher in this field. Research has achieved quite promising prediction accuracies however they were evaluated the the non-existent datasets from various imaging modalities which makes it difficult to make the fair comparison with the other methods comparison among them. In this paper, we conducted a study on the effectiveness of using human brain MRI scans to detect Alzheimer's disease and ended with a future discussion of Alzheimerâ€™s research trends.
